# Online-Gaming-Behavior-Analytics

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior data from a global e-commerce platform to understand engagement patterns, purchasing behavior, and churn risk. The analysis combines exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning models to derive actionable business insights.

📂 Dataset Information

Description: The Online Gaming Behavior Insights Dataset provides a comprehensive view of player behavior patterns across different demographics, game genres, and engagement levels. This dataset is designed to support exploratory data analysis, behavioral analytics, and predictive modeling related to online gaming habits. It captures how players interact with games in terms of playtime, session frequency, difficulty preference, progression, and engagement intensity.

With over 40,000 player records, this dataset is suitable for both beginner and advanced data science tasks, including visualization, clustering, classification, and behavioral trend analysis.

🔍 Analysis Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data consistency checks
Handling anomalies and missing values
Feature understanding
2. Data Visualization
Key questions explored:

What is the distribution of customers’ age and gender?

Which countries or cities have the highest number of customers?

Is there a relationship between login frequency and average session duration?

How does age relate to mobile app usage?

Which age groups tend to have the highest total purchases?

Which age groups use discounts most frequently?

Does higher total purchase lead to higher discount usage?

Do customers who log in less frequently have a higher chance of churn?

Do customers with fewer purchases have a higher chance of churn?

Do customers with longer days since their last purchase have a higher chance of churning?

3. Predictive Modeling
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
📊 Key Insights from Visualization
The largest customer segment comes from the 36–45 age group, dominated by female customers
The 66–75 age group has the fewest customers, likely due to lower digital adoption
Average total purchases, mobile app usage, and discount usage are similar across age groups
The USA is the largest market, with cities like Houston acting as major customer hubs
Higher login frequency is associated with longer session duration
Customers with lower total purchases tend to use discounts slightly more
Customers with low login frequency and low purchases show a higher risk of churn
🎯 Churn Insights
Churned customers have a lower median login frequency
Customers who purchase less frequently are more likely to churn
Login frequency and total purchases are strong indicators of customer engagement and loyalty
💡 Recommendations
Encourage frequent logins Frequent logins indicate higher engagement. Personalized notifications and reminders can help reduce churn.

Use discounts strategically Discounts are more effective for low-activity customers rather than loyal buyers.

Strengthen loyalty programs High-purchase customers value exclusivity more than discounts.

Focus on high-performing regions Strengthen marketing in top cities while using localized strategies in underperforming regions.

Support older customers Simplified interfaces and better guidance can improve engagement among older users.

🤖 Machine Learning Results
Logistic Regression
Accuracy: ~78%
Recall (churn): ~42%
ROC-AUC: ~0.79 → Suitable as a baseline but limited in identifying churned customers.
Random Forest (Tuned)
Accuracy: ~90.7%
ROC-AUC improved from 0.86 → 0.92
Higher recall for churned customers → Stronger discrimination and better business applicability.
✅ Final Conclusion
This analysis shows that customer engagement especially login frequency and purchasing activity plays a more important role in churn behavior than demographic factors such as age. While age and gender describe customer distribution, behavioral metrics are stronger predictors of retention. The tuned Random Forest model provides the most effective solution for churn prediction and can support data-driven retention strategies.
